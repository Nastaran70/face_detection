#Face Detection Using OpenCV

This is a simple code for face detection using the OpenCV DNN Face Detector. I have used cv2.dnn.readNetFromTensorflow .
The file opencv_face_detection.py will prompt the user to give the path to an image for detecting faces.
The file cam_opencv_face_detection.py will use a camera to capture an image and detects faces. Use the "q" key to capture image. press any key to proceed to detection. Tested and worked on laptop camera.
Both will leave the original image window open and show the bonding box in a new window. press any key to proceed to detection.
